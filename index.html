		</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>
            Photograph Editing - My wife is amazing photographer and I love to work with her in editing them. We do weddings, birthdays, family photos- you name it.

            </li>
			<li>
				Italian - My family’s heritage comes from Sicily, Italy. I love the culter, the food and the language. I started studing on my own in after taking courses through my high school and have been working on it ever since. I have dreamed of visiting Italy my entire life and finally made my first trip in November of 2012.
           </li>
		   <li>
				Apologetics I am a Christian which means I am a follow of Jesus Christ. Apologetics is If there was one verse that feeds  my desire to  study apologetics it would be 1 Peter 3:15:<br />
	“...but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy,  always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks  you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with 
gentleness and respect...”
