        <p> 
        	I prefer to spend my free time with my family, but I do have several hobbies and skills that I like to stay active in:
		</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>
            <strong>Photograph Editing</strong> - My wife is an amazing photographer and I love to work with her in editing her photos. We do weddings, birthdays, family photos- you name it.
			</li>
            <li>
				<strong>Guitar</strong> - I enjoy playing acoustic and electric guitar and enjoy a wide range of genres- Classical, Blues/Jazz, and anything with a Celtic feel.
            </li>
			<li>
				<strong>Italian</strong> - My family’s heritage comes from Sicily, Italy. I love the culture, the food and the language. I started studying on my own after taking courses through my high school and have been working on it ever since. I have dreamed of visiting Italy my entire life and finally made my first trip in November of 2012.
           </li>
		   <li>
				<strong>Apologetics</strong> - Apologetics is the discipline of defending a position through the systematic use of information. I am a Christian which means I am a follower of Jesus Christ. If there was one verse that feed  my desire to  study apologetics it would be 1 Peter 3:15:<br />
	<i>“...but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy,  always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks  you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with 
gentleness and respect...”</i>
